# Predicting Car Crash Culpability

## Outline
This is a predictive model built on a linear SVC framework that analyzes various driving conditions to determine driver culpability in car crashes. I managed to achieve a relatively high accuracy and precision when predicting driver fault. The data set cleaned and tidied using regex and string replacement.
